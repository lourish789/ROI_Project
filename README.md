# ROI_Project

Team ROI built an ML Model to predict the JAMB scores of candidates based on their features and performance.

Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/idowuadamo/students-performance-in-2024-jamb

The more was built using the following framework;
Python
Jupyter Notebook 
Gradio 
Huggingface 

We performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset to extract insights and check the relationship between the variables 





To deploy the model, the model was saved to a pickle file file 

Then, it was deployed via gradio on huggingfaces. here is the link tonthe web app; https://huggingface.co/spaces/Fluospark128/ROI_Project
